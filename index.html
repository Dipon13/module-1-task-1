                <h1>ABOUT ME :</h1>
                <p>I was fascinated by coding and computer programming since my school days. I had studied computer
                    science as a core discipline in my graduatiuon . After graduation I started teaching Computer in
                    Schools. But I always wanted to persue a career in web development which is both creative and
                    dynamic. I came across this oportunity in the website of Zivrus which was told to me by one of my
                    friend. I am really excited to learn new web development tools and looking forward to complete all
                    the stipulated task. I am eager to work and prove my abilities in the required field. <br>
                    Hard work, communication skills, presentation skills are some of my strengths. This flexibility
                    will help me in a workspace where there are many different personalities and working styles.
